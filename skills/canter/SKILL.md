# canter

canter is a public companion CLI for operating Herdr coding-agent
fleets. Roadmap slices #3-#10 are merged on `staging` (PRs #13-#21): a
read-only CLI core (#4), a daemon foundation with SQLite state and a local
socket RPC (#5), the deterministic workflow engine with the bundled
Doctrine default workflow (#6), the capability-negotiated harness adapters
(#7: Hermes, Claude Code, Codex + a declarative generic argv adapter;
#33 adds Pi, earendil-works/pi, with a measured 0.85.1 floor; #37 adds
Jcode, 1jehuang/jcode, with a measured 0.84.0 floor — all
verified with fake-executable contract tests that need no credentials), the
control-plane mutation layer (#8: the daemon mediates plan `apply` — one
typed, digest-bound, capability-gated plan step per request — with durable
review-evidence rows, recorded first-real-write approvals, and
worktree-confined harness execution), the lifecycle layer (#9: durable
recurring non-destructive schedules with single-flight/coalesced evaluation
and cold-boot recovery, fan-out admission, cleanup archive/salvage with
byte-verified manifests, a verified system-SSH remote transport contract,
and retention-bounded backup pruning), and the release-readiness layer
(#10: deterministic platform archives with checksums, offline SPDX SBOM,
release provenance; clean-host verification; measured baselines; in-repo
release policy). The daemon never starts/stops Herdr, the CLI never mutates
repositories or fleet state directly, and no live workflow execution,
release execution, or real harness session runs from public CI (those are
human-gated). Issue #35 verifies Herdr 0.9.0's current behavior with isolated
live probes and portable contract tests: same-version protocol 22 is green,
while both 0.8.2/protocol-20 mixed directions fail closed. The doctor minimum
therefore remains 0.8.2 and is not a mixed-server compatibility claim.

## When to use

- You are contributing to the canter repository (Rust, docs,
  contracts, CI).
- You need to know what the CLI does today — or operate it read-only —
  without guessing.

## Product name and pre-rename compatibility (issue #106)

The product/repository is `canter` (renamed from `herdr-fleet`; old GitHub
URLs redirect). The pre-rename binary name, state/runtime tree, config path,
and debug crash-point env var keep working, and live Herdr integration ids
keep their pre-rename spelling — the normative list is
`docs/contracts/compatibility.md` ("Product rename (issue #106)"). Use
`canter` in new work; do not rename live registry/session identity.

## Safe discovery (read-only, no side effects)

1. Index and status: `README.md` (current surface, boundaries, quickstart).
2. Operations runbook: `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (task-ordered; every claim
   exercised against the real binary).
3. Contracts: `docs/contracts/README.md` (schema registry, specs for
   CLI/config/plans/daemon/state/capabilities, capability-map,
   compatibility — the #3 corpus this surface implements).
4. Canonical gates: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (`just ci` is the full local
   aggregate).
5. Process: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`; architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
   the ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.
6. Repository contract for agents: `AGENTS.md` (public-data boundary,
   branch discipline, smallest-change rule).
7. To inspect the compiled binary (after `cargo build --locked`):
   `canter --help`, then per command.

## Command surface (100% of `--help`; classification per command)

| Command | Classification | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config init` | read-only | Prints an annotated `hf-config/v1` TOML template to stdout (writes nothing). |
| `config validate [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only | Validates the config document and its named policy overlay (exit 5 refusals on unknown keys/versions/overlays). |
| `config show [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only | Renders the effective configuration (repositories, identities, harnesses, daemon, policy). |
| `doctor [--json]` | read-only | Checks git/herdr(>=0.8.2)/gh + config; never installs/starts anything. Exit 0 ok, 3 missing/degraded, 5 invalid config. |
| `status [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only | Bounded observation of configured repositories from inside the local checkout (git + authenticated `gh` + herdr probe); degradation explicit. |
| `plan <repository> <issue> [--revision HEX40] [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only (renders; NEVER applies) | Deterministic `hf-plan/v1` with canonical sha256 digest + redacted acceptance-revision binding. |
| `capabilities [--json]` | read-only | Declared forge read capabilities (`read_refs`, `read_issues`, `read_checks`). |
| `daemon run [--socket PATH] [--config PATH]` | local state server (no fleet/external mutation) | Foreground single-writer daemon: flock, SQLite state open/migrated, interrupted-claim reconciliation, `hf-rpc/v1` on the per-user Unix socket. Second daemon refused. |
| `daemon status [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only probe | Live daemon + state facts; exit 1 `daemon.absent`/`daemon.stale` when not running. |
| `service doctor [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only | Daemon-environment checks (platform, config, socket, unit placement). |
| `service install-plan [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only (renders; never activates) | Renders the per-user launchd/systemd unit text + install steps. |
| `service status-plan [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only (renders) | Renders verification steps for the unit. |
| `service uninstall-plan [--config PATH] [--json]` | read-only (renders) | Renders removal steps for the unit. |
| daemon `apply` RPC (NOT a CLI subcommand) | **grant-gated mutation** | One digest-bound plan step per request over the socket, idempotency-keyed, journaled before effect; typed `hf-outcome/v1`. |

There is no CLI mutation command. Any task that needs a fleet mutation must
route through the daemon `apply` RPC with an authorized route grant — never
through a workaround.

## JSON envelope contract

- `--json` commands write exactly one `hf-output/v1` document to stdout:
  `schema`, `command`, `kind` (`ok` | `error` | `partial`), `data` or
  `error` (with stable `code`, `retryable`), `exit_code`.
- Exit codes (with or without `--json`): 0 ok · 1 operational error ·
  2 usage · 3 partial · 4 refusal · 5 config error.
- Diagnostics go to stderr; JSON output never prompts. Adapter reads run
  through a bounded env-isolated runner with one redaction pass at the
  boundary (never trust/shell-evaluate adapter or remote text).

## Observe → plan (read-only) flow — do this unaided first

1. Build: `cargo build --locked` (release: add `--release`).
2. `canter config init > ~/.config/canter/config.toml`, edit it
   to the repository you operate, then
   `canter config validate --json` → expect `kind:"ok"`, exit 0
   (`config.invalid` exit 5 = fix the document).
3. `canter doctor --json` → expect all checks `status:"ok"`, exit 0
   (exit 3 = a prerequisite is missing/degraded — install/auth the named
   tool, never have the CLI do it).
4. From inside the repository's local checkout:
   `canter status --json` → expect `freshness:"fresh"` and
   `observed_repositories >= 1`, exit 0; `git.available:false` /
   `github.available:false` are explicit degradations, not errors.
5. `canter plan <owner/name> <issue> --revision <40-hex> --json` →
   expect `kind:"ok"`, exit 0, with a `hf-plan/v1` document, `plan_id`,
   `digest` (sha256 over canonical bytes), and `state_epoch`. Without
   `--revision`, authenticated `gh` is required (else exit 1
   `forge.unavailable`; the message suggests offline mode). Rerun the same
   command and diff: output is byte-deterministic.

Never present `plan` output as applied work — plans are read-only
renderings until an authorized grant + daemon `apply` executes them.

## Plan digest + grant flow (mutations, #8 semantics)

- The digest binds the plan: same inputs → same canonical bytes → same
  `digest`; tampered bytes are refused at apply (`refusal.plan.identity`).
- A route grant (`hf-grant/v1`) is the only authorization to start durable
  work: it binds repository, plan digest, capabilities, role/policy
  hashes, `state_epoch`, expiry, and instance; grants expire and die with
  their epoch (material edits or restore rotate the epoch and invalidate
  prior grants).
- `apply` runs ONE plan step per request, requires `params.idempotency_key`
  (`ik_` + 8-64 `[a-z0-9-]`), revalidates live under the state lock
  (epoch/grant/expiry/revision/hashes/capability) and journals
  (`mutate.*`) before the effect. Replaying a consumed key returns the
  recorded response (at-most-once dispatch, exactly-once read-back).
- Outcomes are typed `hf-outcome/v1`: `succeeded` | `failed` | `refused` |
  `ambiguous` | `superseded`. `ambiguous` (crash/timeout/restore) always
  requires external reconciliation before a new key.
- Kind gates: merge needs current review evidence bound to the exact head
  (`refusal.evidence.stale` on moved bindings); issue closure requires the
  instance at `post_merge_verify` with passing evidence; production-branch
  effects need a fresh interactive TTY-confirmed digest; real-external
  scopes need the recorded first-write approval.
- Normative sources (link, never duplicate): `docs/contracts/spec-plans.md`
  (apply semantics, grants, epochs, idempotency), `docs/contracts/
  spec-daemon.md` (RPC request/response, methods, replay),
  `docs/contracts/spec-review-evidence.md` (evidence rows).
- Tests that prove these flows: `tests/mutation_engine.rs` (socket-level
  flows over disposable local repositories), `tests/daemon_rpc.rs`,
  `tests/daemon_lifecycle.rs` — no credentials, no external state.

## Bundled Doctrine default workflow (#6, link not duplicate)

- Canonical source (versioned + hash-pinned):
  `schemas/fixtures/workflow/workflow.doctrine.json` (`workflow_id`
  `fleet-doctrine-1`, `hf-workflow/v1`).
- Normative spec and engine rules: `docs/contracts/spec-workflow.md`
  ("Engine semantics" and "Bundled Doctrine default").
- Rust embedding + pinned digest: `src/engine.rs`
  (`engine::doctrine_default`, `engine::DOCTRINE_DIGEST`).
- The public skill uses this workflow's model-agnostic default roles
  (orchestrator/implementer/reviewer); workflow content can never carry
  policy, capabilities, target, or approval authority.

## Harness adapters (#7/#33/#37, link not duplicate)

- Normative contract: `docs/contracts/spec-capabilities.md` ("Adapter
  contract") — closed operation set, typed refusal codes, identity-triple
  rule, fake-adapter doctrine.
- Declared version ranges and measured version facts:
  `docs/contracts/compatibility.md` — Hermes 0.21.0, Claude Code 2.1.263,
  Codex 0.153.4 (measured 2026-09-06), Pi 0.85.1 (earendil-works/pi,
  measured 2026-09-08; darwin prebuilts available at that version, parity
  human-gated) and Jcode 0.84.0 (1jehuang/jcode, measured 2026-09-08
  against the SHA-verified linux-x64 prebuilt; darwin prebuilts available
  at that version, parity human-gated; issue #37 darwin canary peak RSS
  ~19.9 MB).
- Rust implementation: `src/adapters.rs` (`canter::adapters`);
  contract tests with fake executables: `tests/harness_adapters.rs` — the
  shared fixture loop drives every official adapter (hermes, claude-code,
  codex, pi, jcode) plus the argv fake; public CI and fork PRs need no
  harness credentials. Real harness parity is a human-gated clean-host
  smoke, never run from this repository's CI (the issue #33 lane ran one
  local pi live smoke outside CI as sandbox evidence; the issue #37 lane
  ran the real jcode binary's probe/argv rows outside CI — see
  `.report-37.md`).

## Control-plane mutations (#8, link not duplicate)

- Normative contract: `docs/contracts/spec-plans.md` ("Apply semantics")
  and `docs/contracts/spec-review-evidence.md` (durable evidence rows).
- Rust implementation: `src/mutation.rs` (`canter::mutation` engine +
  effect registry), `src/daemon.rs` (`plan`/`apply` RPC handlers), durable
  rows + invalidation semantics in `src/state.rs`.
- Acceptance tests: `tests/mutation_engine.rs` (socket-level flows over
  disposable local repositories) — public CI needs no credentials.

## Lifecycle, cleanup, and recovery (#9 — pointers)

- Schedules/admission/cleanup-archive/recovery/remote semantics:
  `docs/contracts/spec-lifecycle.md` (recurring non-destructive
  `hf-schedule/v1`; cold boot runs one fresh evaluation per due schedule
  before the socket serves; fan-out admission refuses without host-resource
  proofs or on monorepo overlap; cleanup archives with byte-verified
  salvage manifests; system-SSH remote transport is a verified contract).
- Daemon recovery: after a crash/kill, `daemon status --json` reports
  `daemon.stale` (exit 1, retryable); a fresh `daemon run` reclaims the
  socket, migrates state, reconciles interrupted claims, and serves —
  read-only commands never need the daemon.
- State/journal/backup: `docs/contracts/spec-state.md` (migrations
  m0001-m0008, audit/event journals, backup/restore with retention);
  restore rotates the epoch and invalidates prior grants.
- Operations runbook: `docs/OPERATIONS.md` sections 5, 7, 8 (daemon
  lifecycle, cleanup/archives, recovery after crash/cold boot).
- Release archives/provenance/upgrade: `docs/RELEASING.md` (execution
  human-gated).

## Release readiness (#10, link not duplicate)

- Normative contract + version/schema policy + documented command rows:
  `docs/RELEASING.md` (in-repo machinery active; release EXECUTION
  human-gated).
- Deterministic archive builder + verifier (`scripts/build-archive.py`,
  `scripts/test-build-archive.py`): platform archives with SHA-256
  checksums, offline SPDX SBOM from `Cargo.lock`, and
  `release-provenance/v1` records.
- Clean-host verification (`scripts/clean-host-verify.sh`,
  `scripts/clean-host-probe.py`, `scripts/test-clean-host-probe.py`).
- Baseline machinery + committed table (`scripts/measure-baseline.py`,
  `docs/contracts/baseline-linux-x86_64.csv`,
  `docs/contracts/benchmarks.md`): never a CI gate.
- Compatibility probe mapping: `docs/contracts/compatibility.md`.

## Herdr 0.9 compatibility (#35 — pointers)

- Canonical matrix and evidence classes:
  `docs/contracts/compatibility.md` (same-version 0.9.0 green; both
  0.8.2/0.9.0 mixed protocol directions red and fail closed).
- Portable discriminating tests: `tests/herdr_compatibility.rs` (subscribe
  before snapshot, no retained replay, explicit group close, prompt activity
  gate, unscrolled recent reads, and the #9 no-dependency guard).
- `HERDR_MINIMUM` remains 0.8.2 because the mixed matrix is red. Treat it as
  the supported CLI floor, never as permission to operate mismatched
  protocol-20/protocol-22 endpoints; update Herdr endpoints together through
  Herdr's own workflow, never from canter.

## Safety direction (plan/apply gates)

Mutations are typed, digest-bound, journaled before effect, exactly read
back, and revalidated against live grant/instance/epoch state immediately
before the effect; production/destructive actions require fresh interactive
TTY confirmation (and recorded first-write approval for real-external
scopes) and can never be scheduled. Any proposal to add mutation behavior
outside this machinery is out-of-scope and routes through the roadmap.

## Adapter-example note

Hermes (or any agent harness) may appear in this repository only as a
clearly labeled *adapter example* of the harness-neutral design — never as
a required invocation path, profile layout, or core dependency. This skill
is usable with any harness or with none.

## Making this skill available to Pi lanes (issue #33 A1) and Jcode lanes (issue #37)

Hermes lanes read this skill from the profile skill directory. Pi lanes
(the pi harness adapter, issue #33) load the same operating knowledge
through pi's native skills discovery (pi `docs/skills.md`; this directory
is a standard skill: `SKILL.md` + freeform files):

- Global: symlink (keeps the relative `docs/...` links working) or copy
  this directory to `~/.pi/agent/skills/canter/`.
- Project: `cp -r skills/canter <worktree>/.pi/skills/` (project
  skills load once the project is trusted).
- One-shot/CLI: `pi --skill <repo>/skills/canter ...` (repeatable,
  additive even with `--no-skills`).

Verified 2026-09-08 (issue #33 A1): a real pi session loaded this skill
and answered a canter usage question from the skill content alone —
redacted Q/A evidence in `.report-33.md`.

Jcode lanes (the jcode harness adapter, issue #37) have no skill
discovery surface in v0.84.0: the real binary's command list exposes no
skill subcommand and `run` accepts no `--skill` flag (verified 2026-09-08
against the v0.84.0 linux-x64 prebuilt). For one-shot jcode lanes the
skill content travels as prompt data — the adapter delivers the brief
text (which may reference this skill's sections) as the payload of the
documented `run` row, and the lane reads the referenced repository files
itself. This repository keeps exactly one canonical copy of the skill
(here); nothing is duplicated for jcode.

## Repository rules that bind work here

- Public-data rule: never commit host paths, private repository names,
  credentials, provider/model policy, or live scheduler identity (CI scans
  every PR).
- Branches: PRs target `staging`; `main` changes only via human promotion
  (or the documented hotfix exception).
- License: Apache-2.0 OR MIT; DCO not adopted.
