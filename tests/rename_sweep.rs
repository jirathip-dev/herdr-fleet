//! Issue #106 rename sweep: no stale `herdr-fleet` product-surface
//! reference may survive in the tracked tree outside the documented
//! legacy/historical set.
//!
//! The normative set is docs/contracts/compatibility.md, "Product rename
//! (issue #106)". Every file that is *expected* to carry the pre-rename
//! name is listed below with its **exact pinned occurrence count** on
//! purpose: adding or removing such a mention is a compatibility-contract
//! change, not a chore, so the count must be re-reviewed and updated
//! together with that section (and the CHANGELOG note).
//!
//! Two whole groups are excluded by design and were not scanned before
//! either:
//! * `.report-*.md` — historical lane reports, kept as written;
//! * `docs/architecture/herdr-fleet.*` — frozen, SHA-256-pinned v0.1.0 /
//!   locked-target render artifacts (filenames and rendered titles
//!   included);
//! * this file itself (it defines the needles it scans for).
//!
//! The scan runs over `git ls-files`, i.e. exactly the tracked tree — a
//! build directory, scratch files, or untracked fixtures can never mask a
//! committed regression.
