//! Portable lifecycle behavior (issue #9): recurring non-destructive
//! schedule evaluation (single-flight, coalesced, no catch-up replay) and
//! admission for concurrent lane fan-out (global/per-repository/per-harness
//! caps, fresh host-resource proof, monorepo scope overlap).
//!
//! The daemon owns every durable write and all clock reads; this module is
//! pure policy plus the reconcile driver over `state::State`. Wall-clock
//! movement, sleep, and DST transitions all surface as jumps of the `now`
//! argument, so every scenario is unit-testable with explicit Unix seconds
//! (no injectable clock exists by design — see `crate::time`).
//!
//! Schedule semantics (normative, docs/contracts/spec-lifecycle.md):
//!
//! - A schedule doc pins an `anchor` (RFC3339 UTC) and `every_secs`; the
//!   evaluation windows are `anchor + k * every_secs` forever (no drift,
//!   no wall-clock phase chasing).
//! - One evaluation per window, at most. When a tick finds the window in
//!   the past (sleep, reboot, DST/wall-clock jumps), the schedule fires
//!   exactly ONCE and re-anchors its persisted `next_run_at` to the next
//!   boundary strictly after now — missed windows are skipped, never
//!   replayed (no catch-up storm).
//! - The persisted `next_run_at` is the single-flight guard: a second
//!   evaluation in the same tick skips. Paused (`enabled = 0`) schedules
//!   never run; nothing in this module ever enables a schedule.
//! - A refusal (expired, changed policy/issue binding, unparseable doc)
//!   parks the schedule in an explicit terminal paused state with a
//!   journaled reason — no retry storm. Resume is an explicit human RPC.
