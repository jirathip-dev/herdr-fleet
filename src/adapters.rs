//! Harness adapters (issues #7, #33, #37): capability-negotiated adapters
//! for Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, Pi (earendil-works/pi), Jcode
//! (1jehuang/jcode), and the declarative generic argv adapter.
//!
//! # Adapter contract (docs/contracts/spec-capabilities.md, "Adapter
//! contract", issue #7)
//!
//! Every adapter profile declares an `hf-capability/v1` document (axis
//! `harness`, closed 7-capability set) and executes typed operations through
//! [`crate::process::run`]: argv arrays only, allowlisted environment only,
//! per-op deadline, capped + redacted output, typed exits. Prompts and
//! untrusted issue text are transported as data — a single final argv
//! element on the prompt operation — and can never alter adapter argv or
//! policy. Adapters never write files, never read the host environment
//! directly (the caller passes an allowlisted environment map), and never
//! store tokens or transcripts (trust model T5 / AC8).
//!
//! - Hermes / Claude Code / Codex / Pi / Jcode are the five official 1.0
//!   adapters (adapter examples per ADR-0003; metadata lives here, never
//!   in core planning). Their declared version ranges are recorded in
//!   docs/contracts/compatibility.md (Hermes/Claude Code/Codex measured
//!   2026-09-06; Pi 0.85.1 measured 2026-09-08 against the SHA-verified
//!   linux-x64 prebuilt, with darwin arm64/x64 prebuilts available at that
//!   version; Jcode 0.84.0 measured 2026-09-08 against the SHA-verified
//!   linux-x64 prebuilt of the upstream release, with darwin arm64/x64
//!   prebuilts available at that version); the exact real-world flag
//!   parity of the headless invocation rows is [awaiting-evidence] until
//!   the human-gated clean-host smokes run (AC6), so this slice verifies
//!   the contract with fake executables only (AC7).
//! - The `argv` kind is the declarative generic adapter: validated static
//!   argv prefixes per operation, explicit capability declarations, bare
//!   executable names resolved through the allowlisted PATH (the resolved
//!   absolute identity is what is spawned), bounded time/output, typed
//!   exits. No shell evaluation, no command templates, no capability
//!   inference from prose, no dynamic plugin SDK.
//! - Session identity (AC3) binds the Herdr workspace session id plus a
//!   stable terminal/native-session identity plus a generation counter.
//!   A mutable pane label is not part of the identity and can never
//!   substitute for any of the three parts; binding without all three is a
//!   typed refusal (`refusal.identity.incomplete`).
//! - One-shot official adapter lane lifecycle under Herdr (issues #33 A2,
//!   #37): when a pi or jcode profile operation runs inside a Herdr pane
//!   (`HERDR_ENV=1` + `HERDR_PANE_ID` in the allowlisted environment), the
//!   adapter reports the lane lifecycle through the workspace executable's
//!   `pane report-agent` row (custom-integration contract: pi reports
//!   `--source custom:herdr-fleet-pi --agent pi`; jcode reports
//!   `--source custom:herdr-fleet-jcode --agent jcode`). `start` reports
//!   `working`; a terminal `prompt` reports
//!   `idle` (Herdr has no done state), except `refusal.credentials` (a user
//!   decision — the provider key — is required) and
//!   `refusal.binding.missing` (the profile declares no provider/model
//!   binding, so a user decision — declare the binding — is required),
//!   which report `blocked` with static messages that never carry
//!   credential or binding detail. Reporting is
//!   best-effort and never changes the typed op result, and is a no-op
//!   outside Herdr. `herdr agent start --kind pi` remains the
//!   substrate/orchestrator path for interactive pi panes (requires a pane
//!   at an interactive shell prompt); headless adapter runs report through
//!   the pane rows instead.
//! - Unknown or unavailable harnesses fail with a typed refusal
//!   (`unknown.harness`, `refusal.unavailable.harness`) and never disturb
//!   independent read-only operations (observe.rs pattern, AC4).
