//! Control-plane mutation engine (issue #8).
//!
//! Plan-first, daemon-mediated repository workflow effects: typed
//! operations (worktree/branch creation, lane-bound harness start, bounded
//! prompt delivery, commit/head collection, branch push, GitHub issue/PR
//! updates, hosted-check observation, review evidence, integration merge,
//! post-merge verification, branch deletion, deterministic lane cleanup)
//! executed by the daemon after validating workflow authority.
//!
//! Locked-spec rules implemented here:
//! - apply binds the exact plan digest and freshly revalidates canonical
//!   target, observations, issue revision, workflow/policy hashes, and the
//!   state epoch immediately before every effect (spec-plans.md);
//! - stale/expired grants refuse mutation with a typed code (C2); grants
//!   die with their epoch;
//! - worker/LLM/harness output can never directly invoke a transition or
//!   downgrade risk: effect *declarations* come from typed plan step params
//!   and are mapped through the static capability/phase/risk tables below
//!   (AC3, risk-model.md non-downgrade rule);
//! - main/production and hotfix rules are pure policy probes with RED/GREEN
//!   tests; no direct/force-push path exists (AC6);
//! - review/CI evidence invalidates on any relevant head/base/workflow/
//!   policy change (AC4, spec-review-evidence.md);
//! - issue closure only after integration merge + post-merge verification
//!   (AC7); cleanup refuses dirty/ambiguous/uncontained/unverified targets
//!   and preserves required salvage evidence (AC8, journaled by the daemon
//!   through [`crate::state::State::journal_salvage`]);
//! - the first real external write requires a separate recorded human
//!   approval (AC10; the canary itself is a later human-gated step — this
//!   slice proves the gate with fakes only).
//!
//! This module is deterministic and daemon-independent: it takes typed
//! snapshots and an allowlisted environment and returns typed outcomes with
//! exact read-backs. The daemon owns journaling, claims, and durable
//! records (review evidence, approvals, salvage) before/after calling the
//! effect handlers.
