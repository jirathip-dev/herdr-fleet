//! Supervised reconciliation driver (issue #95): durable, event-driven
//! evaluation of explicitly authorized runs, with a bounded timer fallback
//! and NO continuation effect.
//!
//! Scope of this slice, stated positively and negatively:
//!
//! - Supervision is **disabled by default**: a run is supervised only when
//!   an explicit `hf-supervision-authorization/v1` block was presented as
//!   part of its queue submission (#85) and committed with it. The
//!   authorization binds the approved preview digest, so a run whose
//!   recorded binding no longer matches (unapproved/drifted plan) is
//!   classified `unknown`/held and is never eligible.
//! - The driver **evaluates and reports**, and performs exactly ONE bounded
//!   continuation effect (issue #96): when the recorded evidence of an
//!   authorized run is a fresh VERIFIED delivery (reviewed `pass` with every
//!   named check `passed` at the recorded delivered head, bound to the run's
//!   own workflow/policy pins), the driver advances that run's
//!   already-authorized queue cursor — once per delivered issue — and admits
//!   the next eligible approved issue of the SAME committed submission under
//!   the existing admission and ownership checks. It never spawns, prompts,
//!   resumes, retries, mutates Git or clears a hold: the admitted run is a
//!   durable run record and no workflow step is executed. `continuation-eligible`
//!   stays a REPORT for a later slice.
//! - A duplicate delivery event, a replayed check or a crash/restart never
//!   duplicates a dispatch: the advance is keyed to the delivered issue
//!   (one consumption per submission item, ever) and the cursor is derived
//!   from the durable advance rows.
//! - Every classification is derived from **recorded evidence** re-read from
//!   the daemon state (run row, ownership, committed submission, bound step
//!   spine, recorded step attempts with their typed outcome codes, review
//!   evidence, bounded retries, in-flight claims). Evidence that is missing
//!   or stale stays `unknown`/held; an idle or `done` agent alone is neither
//!   completion nor permission to resume.
//! - Wakes are **coalesced per run**: semantic completion/review/CI events
//!   (folded from the durable event stream) and the bounded timer fallback
//!   both feed ONE pending trigger per run, so duplicate, out-of-order and
//!   concurrent timer/event wakes produce exactly one run-scoped
//!   reconciliation.
//! - The meaningful-progress marker moves only when recorded evidence
//!   actually changed: reads, heartbeats and rendered status never reset it,
//!   so the progress timeout identifies the **absence of evidence**, not
//!   useful reasoning, and long-running work or known waits never re-report
//!   a continuation. A run with NO recorded observation yet is **held**
//!   (`unknown` / `supervision.progress_unobserved`, never eligible): an
//!   unobserved run is not a timed-out one, so a fresh arm can never open a
//!   continuation window.
//! - Reads report **committed** state: `supervision.status` renders the
//!   recorded result of the last committed check as `class`/`reason`/
//!   `eligible`, carries the read-time re-classification separately as
//!   `observed`, and keeps the continuation block as durable window state.
//!   A read can therefore never re-classify to a friendlier class and hide a
//!   committed counter.
//! - All time arithmetic takes `now_unix` as an explicit argument (the same
//!   design as `crate::lifecycle`): wall-clock movement and sleep surface as
//!   jumps of that argument and re-anchor the next eligible check to the
//!   future, so a jump yields one fresh reconciliation instead of catch-up
//!   effects. No injectable clock type exists by design.
//!
//! The daemon owns the state transactions and the thread; this module owns
//! the policy, the pure classification and the driver loop that takes the
//! state guard only for short reads and writes (never across a wait).
