//! Queue preview (issue #84): the deterministic, effect-free preview of one
//! exact selected-issue run.
//!
//! The preview is a pure projection. It normalizes and deduplicates the
//! stable issue identities, binds the reviewable inputs into one
//! content-addressed digest, orders the selected work by its declared
//! dependencies, projects durable ownership and current occupancy, and
//! reports every unmet prerequisite as a NAMED hold — never as apparent
//! readiness.
//!
//! Contract rules (documented, stable surface):
//! - Identity is the stable `owner/name#number` form (repository identity +
//!   issue number, ASCII-lowercased) and nothing else: titles are display
//!   text that never identify, never dedupe and never enter the digest.
//! - `digest` is sha256 over the canonical bytes of the bound-input document
//!   (the rendered `request`): identical inputs always produce identical
//!   bytes and digest, and any input change (a selected spec revision, the
//!   host, the workflow pin, the role-configuration revision, the allowed
//!   completion boundary, the selected set, a dependency edge or a step
//!   binding) moves the digest — so an authorization given for the old
//!   digest is refused (`refusal.plan.stale`) before anything runs.
//! - Observed state (host availability, harness occupancy, credential
//!   presence, running lanes) never changes the digest: it produces holds.
//!   The authorization binds the plan; admission is revalidated at run time
//!   exactly like the existing fan-out gate.
//! - A required dependency that is not part of the selected set is shown as
//!   an unresolved requirement on its dependent and is never silently added
//!   to the selected scope; cross-repository references are linked
//!   dependencies only (one authoritative workflow per repository).
//! - Missing occupancy is never assumed to be spare capacity, and unknown
//!   host availability, missing credentials, unsupported executable steps,
//!   protected-branch boundaries and unsatisfiable concurrency all surface
//!   as named holds.
//! - The preview has NO effects: it spawns nothing, issues no grant, writes
//!   no external state and unpauses nothing. Its only read is the existing
//!   durable state-store read API.
