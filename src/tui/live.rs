//! Live wiring (issue #90): the real read model of #83 adapted to the
//! surface view model.
//!
//! This module is the only path from the daemon state store to the surface.
//! [`LiveBoard`] implements [`ReadModel`] by reading one bounded page
//! through the real read model — [`crate::board::read_board`], which issues
//! the authoritative bounded join [`crate::state::State::board_page_rows`] —
//! and mapping the returned [`BoardRow`]s onto [`WorkRow`]s with closed,
//! documented rules. Nothing else reaches the surface: no second database,
//! no subprocess, no terminal-text inference, and no write path.
//!
//! Faithfulness rules (this module never invents a fact):
//!
//! - every displayed value is a recorded field of the row or the page;
//!   fields the read model reports as `null` (owner, reason, the intent-side
//!   title) stay `None` and render as their explicit unknown forms;
//! - `stage` maps one arm per recorded state of the read model's closed
//!   `stage`/`run_state` vocabulary, and `outcome` follows the delivery
//!   separation: only the read model's `verified` stage (recorded, current
//!   review evidence) is verified delivery, a recorded `done` status is
//!   reported-done (unverified), and nothing else claims delivery;
//! - `attempt` stays unknown: the read model numbers no attempts (several
//!   attempts under one issue are several runs, and therefore several rows),
//!   so the surface never numbers them either;
//! - freshness is the recorded `source.freshness`/`source.completeness`, and
//!   its age is measured from recorded timestamps only (the run's recorded
//!   `progress_at`, or the page's `observed_at` when the run recorded none);
//! - a failed read is stated as offline with the stable error code, and the
//!   last successfully read page stays visible as the last known data.
//!
//! The live path is never labelled synthetic; the explicit synthetic mode
//! stays a separate, explicitly labelled mode (see `tests/tui_board.rs`).
