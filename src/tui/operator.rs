//! Operator authority path (issue #91): exact selection, exact preview,
//! explicit authorization, daemon-owned run.
//!
//! The surface renders the recorded board ([`LiveBoard`]) and, for one
//! explicitly selected work item, the *exact* run that would start: the
//! reviewed bound-input document is re-rendered through the real preview
//! service ([`crate::queue_preview::preview_queue`]) and re-classified
//! through the same revalidation the daemon runs
//! ([`crate::queue_executor::revalidate`]) — the same typed services the CLI
//! uses, never a UI scheduler and never a synthesized shell command.
//!
//! Authorization is a separate, explicit action: the operator opens the
//! preview (`p`), continues to the authorization screen (`Enter`, only when
//! at least one selected item is eligible) and must set the authorization
//! box (`Space`) before `Enter` commits anything. Back, cancel, quit,
//! resize or any other key can never authorize a start, and no key other
//! than that `Enter` reaches the submit path.
//!
//! The start itself is daemon-owned: the surface sends the same
//! `queue.submit` params document the CLI builds
//! ([`crate::queue_executor::submit_params`]) over the daemon socket, so
//! closing the terminal stops nothing — the run lives in the daemon's state
//! store and a reopened surface reads it back through the recorded rows and
//! `queue.status`. An attempt the daemon does not confirm is reported as
//! unknown and is NEVER replayed; the only follow-up is the explicit
//! readback (`r`), which is read-only.
//!
//! The surface writes no state of its own, adds no privilege path (the
//! daemon's review/admission rules decide everything), and displays
//! requested facts and observed facts as distinct blocks with the observed
//! ones read from the daemon.
