//! Compact supervision status and guarded continuation controls (issue #97).
//!
//! This module surfaces the merged #95/#96 supervision state for exactly ONE
//! selected run — the recorded run classification, the stable reason code,
//! evidence freshness, the last committed check, the next eligible check, the
//! blocked reason and the continuation window — and offers the two guarded
//! continuation controls the brief names: a hold (pause automatic
//! continuation) and an authorized continue (resume).
//!
//! Everything displayed is read from the daemon's OWN typed services: the
//! status projection of `supervision.status`
//! ([`crate::supervision::status_doc`], consumed as data) and the run-control
//! projection of `run.status` ([`crate::run_control::control_doc`]). The
//! controls send the SAME params documents the CLI builds
//! ([`crate::run_control::pause_params`] over `run.pause`,
//! [`crate::run_control::resume_params`] over `run.resume`); there is no UI
//! scheduler, no second state store and no synthesized shell command.
//!
//! Honesty rules (pinned by tests):
//!
//! - a missing, stale or unreadable observation is `unknown`/held and never
//!   reads as `healthy`: [`SupervisionView::class_slot`] only reports a
//!   recorded class when the evidence is fresh, committed and the run is
//!   actually armed;
//! - reads report RECORDED state. The committed class/reason/eligibility of
//!   the last check are displayed as recorded and the read-time observation
//!   is carried separately ([`Observed`]); neither replaces the other;
//! - requested and observed effects are distinct blocks; an unconfirmed
//!   request is `UNKNOWN` and is never replayed (the read-only refresh `r` is
//!   the only follow-up);
//! - a paused/gated run renders as paused/gated and is never advanced here:
//!   the resume binds the digest the pause recorded and is a separate
//!   explicit confirmation.
//!
//! Hard rule taken from the merged code (`operator.rs`: the operator submit
//! path presents no supervision block): this surface NEVER arms, disables or
//! nudges the supervised reconciliation driver. Enabling supervision is the
//! CLI's explicit `--supervise arm` authorization committed with the run's
//! submission; nothing in this module can reach it, and no key sequence
//! enables it by accident.
//!
//! Keyboard safety: every effect needs a distinct request key (`h`/`u`), then
//! `Space` setting the confirmation box, then `Enter` committing it. A bare
//! `Enter`, an escape/back key, a resize or any autorepeat/release event
//! effects nothing; every key handler ignores non-`Press` events, so a held
//! key cannot commit a control the operator did not confirm frame by frame.
