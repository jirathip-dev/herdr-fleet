//! Ratatui + Crossterm operator surface (slice #90; consumes the read-model
//! contract of #83 through an explicit interface).
//!
//! This is an independent rendering module. It owns the approved board-first
//! information hierarchy (wide board, narrow single-group view, keyboard-only
//! controls, explicit too-small state) and renders it from an explicitly
//! typed view model: [`BoardView`] arrives through the narrow [`ReadModel`]
//! boundary. The module never opens the daemon database or state files, never
//! shells out, and never infers workflow status from terminal text — status,
//! freshness and completeness are data, and they are rendered as data.
//!
//! Terminal policy: terminal-default foreground/background colours with a
//! small ANSI accent palette ([`ColorMode::Ansi`]) and a monochrome fallback
//! ([`ColorMode::Mono`]) that keeps every textual label and drops every
//! colour. There is no forced green, no fixed RGB background, no embedded
//! chat, no card drag mutation and no fabricated metric: the renderer can
//! only display what the view model carries.
//!
//! Fixture discipline: examples and tests use synthetic identities only
//! (`acme/widgets`, `lane-alpha`, `run-0001`, ...). Provider/model names
//! never appear here; they stay dynamic in profile configuration elsewhere.
