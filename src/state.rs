//! Daemon-owned SQLite state (issue #5, AC2/AC5/AC6).
//!
//! SQLite is the durable authority for leases, idempotency claims, audit
//! records (hash-chained), epochs, grants, workflow instances, schedules,
//! and recovery state. Every write goes through one `Connection` guarded by
//! a mutex: the daemon is the sole writer and the CLI never opens the
//! database (spec-state.md). Writes run with `synchronous=FULL` so a
//! committed transaction is fsynced; any SQLite write failure poisons the
//! state so later mutations fail closed until the process restarts.
//!
//! Journal semantics (spec-state.md AC6): a mutation's intent is journaled
//! in the same transaction that claims its idempotency key (durable before
//! any effect); the typed outcome is journaled when the effect resolves.
//! Audit records form a hash chain: `record_hash = sha256(line || prev)`.
//! Retention is bounded (defaults keep the chain genesis plus the last N
//! rows); the chain genesis row is never pruned so verification always has
//! an anchor.
