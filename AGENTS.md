# AGENTS.md — repository contract for coding agents

herdr-fleet is a **public** repository. The surfaces shipped on `staging`
are implemented and proven by tests that use synthetic fixtures and fake
executables only: a read-only CLI core, a single-writer local daemon
(SQLite state + per-user Unix socket RPC), a deterministic workflow engine
with the bundled Doctrine default workflow, harness adapters, a grant-gated
daemon-mediated mutation path, lifecycle safety, and release-readiness
tooling. **Live workflow execution, release execution, and real harness
sessions are not proved end-to-end and never run from public CI or fork
PRs** — they remain human-gated (see "Shipped vs unverified" below). The
repository itself never mutates real repositories, fleets, or external
state. The umbrella issue #1 tracks the delivery graph; the shipped slices
are listed in [README.md](README.md) (Roadmap).

## Shipped vs unverified

- **Implemented and test-proven (synthetic fixtures / fake executables,
  no credentials, no network):** the read-only CLI (`config`, `doctor`,
  `status`, `plan`, `capabilities`, `service *-plan`); the single-writer
  daemon (`daemon run|status`, SQLite migrations, audit/event journals,
  Unix-socket RPC); the workflow engine and bundled Doctrine default;
  harness adapters for Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Jcode, and the
  declarative generic argv adapter; the grant-gated daemon `apply` mutation
  path (one digest-bound, journaled step per request); lifecycle
  schedules/admission/cleanup/recovery; and release-readiness tooling
  (archives, SBOM, provenance, clean-host scripts).
- **Not proved end-to-end (do not present as done):** live workflow
  execution, release execution, and real harness sessions. Real harness
  parity is a human-gated clean-host smoke (issue #7); release execution is
  human-gated per `docs/RELEASING.md`; no live fleet cutover or real
  external-write canary is authorized by this repository. Public CI and
  fork PRs run with fake executables and synthetic fixtures only.

## Mandatory gates

Run the exact local aggregate before any PR: `just ci` (fmt-check → check →
lint → test → doc → build-release → security) and record raw exit codes;
never pipe a gate through grep as a pass/fail test. `just security` requires
gitleaks — a missing tool is a failure, not a skip. The canonical gate
list, prerequisites, and CI-parity table live in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
Hosted CI mirrors the gates plus policy checks (promotion policy, forbidden
workflow triggers, full-SHA action pins, scanner self-test, required files,
documentation links, staging guard) and secret scans.

## Public-data boundary (hard rule)

Never commit host paths, private repository names, credentials/secret-shaped
content, provider/model policy, or live scheduler identity. The tracked
tree is machine-scanned on every PR (git-index parser + gitleaks); rules are
proven by self-tests. Synthetic `.example` files are permitted; real
credential-class files are rejected. When in doubt, keep it out.

## Branch discipline

- Feature/dependency PRs target `staging` (never `main`). No direct pushes
  to `staging` or `main`; only PR squash merges, linear history.
- Promotion to `main` is a dedicated human-only PR (`staging` → `main`); a
  narrow `hotfix/*` exception exists for incidents (fresh human approval +
  mandatory reconciliation). Details: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
- Release-readiness machinery is active in-repo; release execution
  (promotion, tag, upload, attestation, soak) is human-gated and never runs
  from CI or agent lanes. GitHub Releases is the sole canonical channel; no
  crates.io/Homebrew/plugin-manifest publication exists — see
  `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## Smallest-change discipline

- Prefer the smallest correct diff that satisfies the issue; stdlib first.
  Add a dependency only where a shipped slice proves the need (current set:
  `serde`/`toml`/`sha2` in the read-only core; `rusqlite`/`fs2`/`libc` in
  the daemon). No clap/async/HTTP/tracing.
- No speculative structure: each surface landed with its owning slice and
  its own review; do not add modules, directories, or abstractions before
  their first real owner exists.
- Keep one fact authoritative and link to it: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (gates),
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (modules and boundaries), `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
  (process), `docs/contracts/` (normative contracts).
- This file describes the repository as it is; it authorizes no work. Work
  starts from an issue routed per `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, and nothing here
  authorizes live execution, release execution, or live fleet mutation.
- Commit wording: `Refs #N` (never `Fixes`/`Closes`/`Resolves`).
