Design commitment (locked spec: plan-first, digest-bound, freshly
revalidated, journaled before effect, idempotency-keyed, exactly read back).

## 1. Deterministic plans: `hf-plan/v1`

A plan is the complete, typed description of intended effects for one
issue-bound unit of work: repository identity, pinned workflow id + hash,
the state epoch it was computed against, the exact issue/acceptance
revision, and an ordered list of typed steps.

```json
{"schema":"hf-plan/v1","plan_id":"hf_plan_0123456789abcdef","workflow_id":"fleet-doctrine-1",
 "workflow_hash":"<64hex>","state_epoch":3,"repository":"example-org/widgets",
 "issue":{"number":123,"revision":"<40hex>"},
 "steps":[{"id":"p1","kind":"checkout","params":{"ref":"staging"}}, ...]}
```

Normative rules:

- `issue.revision` is the **exact acceptance revision** the plan is bound
  to (issue body/acceptance text hash or issue-level commit pin recorded by
  the grant issuer). Changing acceptance text invalidates plans bound to
  the old revision.
- Step `kind` is a closed set (`checkout`, `worktree_create`,
  `harness_start`, `prompt`, `collect_outcome`, `review_evidence`, `merge`,
  `cleanup`, `publish`, `branch_push`, `pr_update`, `issue_update`,
  `hosted_check`, `post_merge_verify`, `branch_delete`, `approve`). The
  granular kinds after `publish` are added by issue #8 so a plan document
  can express the full daemon-mediated control-plane mutation surface
  (worktree/branch ops, forge issue/PR updates, hosted-check observation,
  post-merge verification, branch deletion, first-write approval). There is
  no shell/embedded-code step; a document carrying an unknown kind is
  refused (`plan.malformed.json`).
- Plans do not classify risk; risk comes from the target/effect table in
  the daemon ([risk-model.md](risk-model.md)) — nodes cannot downgrade it.

### Canonical serialization and digest

- Canonical bytes: JSON with keys sorted lexicographically, compact
  separators, ASCII escaping, single trailing LF (shared rule,
  [schema-registry.md](schema-registry.md)).
- Plan digest = lowercase hex sha256 over the canonical bytes. `plan.valid.json`
  is stored in canonical form and the manifest pins its known-answer digest;
  `plan.noncanonical.json` (same content, pretty-printed) is refused with
  `REFUSE_NONCANONICAL`.
- The digest is what grants/audit records bind to, and what apply
  revalidation re-computes immediately before effects.

## 2. Route grants: `hf-grant/v1` (AC3)

A route grant is the only authorization to start durable work:

```json
{"schema":"hf-grant/v1","grant_id":"gr_0123456789abcdef","repository":"example-org/widgets",
 "issue":{"number":123,"revision":"<40hex>"},"workflow_hash":"<64hex>","policy_hash":"<64hex>",
 "phase":"merge","scope":"worktrees/issues/123","caps":["read","worktree","spawn","prompt","review","merge"],
 "expires_at":"2026-09-13T00:00:00Z","state_epoch":3,"created_at":"2026-09-06T00:00:00Z"}
```

AC3 bindings, all required fields of the document:

- repository identity (`repository`),
- exact issue and acceptance revision (`issue.number`, `issue.revision`),
- workflow hash (`workflow_hash` — canonical digest of the pinned workflow
  document, [spec-workflow.md](spec-workflow.md)),
- policy hash (`policy_hash` — digest of the effective config+overlay),
- allowed phase (`phase`, closed set), scope (`scope` — path-scoped lanes
  and overlap checks), caps (`caps`, closed subset),
- expiry (`expires_at`),
- state epoch (`state_epoch`).

Semantics: labels/comments alone never authorize (trust model T6). Grants
are consumed/checked by the daemon, expire, and die with their epoch. A
grant missing any binding is refused (`grant.malformed.json` removes
`state_epoch`).

## 3. State epochs: `hf-epoch/v1` (AC7)

Epochs give every durable claim a generation anchor:

```json
{"schema":"hf-epoch/v1","epoch":1,"created_at":"2026-09-06T00:00:00Z",
 "reason":"initial","prior_epoch":null}
```

- The initial epoch has `prior_epoch: null`; every later epoch (reason
  `restore` or `security_rotation`) **must** reference its `prior_epoch`
  (`epoch.malformed.json` drops it).
- **Restore semantics (AC7)**: a restore creates a new state epoch;
  prior grants and digests are invalidated; interrupted work is marked
  ambiguous; external state must be reconciled by a human/operator before
  new grants issue. The `hf-epoch/v1` record with `reason:"restore"` is the
  durable marker of that rotation.

## 4. Idempotency keys

Format: `ik_` + 8-64 `[a-z0-9-]` (registry scalar table). Rules:

- Every mutating apply carries one (`hf-rpc-request/v1` `apply` requires
  `params.idempotency_key`; see [spec-daemon.md](spec-daemon.md)).
- The daemon records the key in the audit journal before the effect (AC6)
  and in the typed outcome; replaying an effect with a consumed key returns
  the recorded outcome instead of re-executing.
- Exactly-once across external systems is never claimed; the key gives
  at-most-once dispatch plus exactly-once read-back of the recorded result.

### Apply semantics (issue #8; daemon `apply`, one plan step per request)

The daemon `apply` method executes ONE plan step per request (the plan is
bound by digest; the step is addressed by id) and is the only path that
runs control-plane effects:

- The request carries the canonical plan document; the daemon recomputes
  the digest and the content-derived `plan_id` before anything is journaled
  (`refusal.plan.identity` on tamper). The plan hash and grant id ride the
  journaled intent.
- Immediately before the effect the daemon revalidates, under the state
  lock: live epoch vs plan/grant/instance, grant status and expiry (an
  expired grant refuses with `refusal.grant.expired`), the observed issue
  revision vs the grant binding, workflow/policy hashes vs the grant and
  the pinned instance, and the step's required capability (`caps`, AC3).
- Kind-specific gates run before the effect: an integration merge requires
  current review evidence (distinct exact-head reviewer + passed checks
  bound to head/base/workflow/policy — any moved binding refuses with
  `refusal.evidence.stale`); issue closure requires the instance to sit at
  the plan's `post_merge_verify` step with passing evidence; cleanup keeps
  its salvage audit pair (`mutate.cleanup` before, `salvage.cleanup`
  after); production-branch effects require a fresh interactive
  TTY-confirmed digest; a real-external target scope requires the recorded
  first-write approval (AC10; the canary itself is a separate human gate).
- The effect runs outside the state lock through allowlisted subprocesses
  (`git` against disposable local repositories in tests; `gh`/workspace
  fakes) and resolves with a typed `hf-outcome/v1` (succeeded/failed/
  refused/ambiguous) plus the exact external read-back; ambiguous effects
  (timeout, process death, post-effect record failure) resolve the claim as
  `ambiguous` — external reconciliation is required before a new key.

## 5. Typed outcomes: `hf-outcome/v1`

Every plan step ends in one typed outcome:

```json
{"schema":"hf-outcome/v1","plan_id":"hf_plan_0123456789abcdef","step_id":"p5",
 "status":"succeeded","idempotency_key":"ik_apply-20260906-0001",
 "observed_at":"2026-09-06T00:00:00Z","result":{"exit_code":0},"error":null}
```

- `status` closed set: `succeeded` | `failed` | `ambiguous` | `refused` |
  `superseded`.
- `failed`/`refused` outcomes must carry an `error` shaped like
  `hf-error/v1` (`outcome.malformed.json` is a failed outcome without one).
- `ambiguous` is reserved for interrupted/restored work (AC7: restore marks
  interrupted work ambiguous) and always requires external reconciliation.
