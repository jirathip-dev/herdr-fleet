# Spec: daemon request/response and local JSONL event protocols

Refs #3. Families: `hf-rpc-request/v1`, `hf-rpc-response/v1`, `hf-event/v1`.
Fixtures under [`rpc/`](../../schemas/fixtures/rpc/request.status.valid.json),
[`event/`](../../schemas/fixtures/event/events.valid.jsonl). Design commitment (locked spec:
one daemon per host on a per-user Unix socket; read-only CLI operations
remain usable without it; SQLite owns state; no network control API).

## Transport

- Per-user Unix socket only (no TCP listener, no network control API in
  1.0). Default path derives from the XDG runtime dir; explicit override
  via `daemon.socket`.
- Newline-delimited JSON-RPC-style exchanges: one `hf-rpc-request/v1`
  document per request line, one `hf-rpc-response/v1` document per response
  line. Request `id` is echoed in the response (8-64 lowercase hex,
  client-generated) and is the replay handle.

## Requests: `hf-rpc-request/v1`

```json
{"schema":"hf-rpc-request/v1","id":"0123456789abcdef0123","method":"status","params":null}
```

- `method` is a closed set: `capabilities`, `doctor`, `status`, `plan`,
  `apply`, `grants.list`, `grants.revoke`, `schedules.list`, `state.epoch`,
  `backup.create`, `restore.begin`, `journal.tail`.
- `apply` **requires** `params.idempotency_key` (`ik_` format): an apply
  without a key is refused at parse time (`rpc/request.malformed.json`).
  Replaying the same request id + idempotency key returns the recorded
  response instead of re-dispatching (daemon replay table).
- Unknown methods are refused with a typed refusal (never guessed).

## Responses: `hf-rpc-response/v1`

```json
{"schema":"hf-rpc-response/v1","id":"0123456789abcdef0123","ok":true,
 "result":{"repository":"example-org/widgets","freshness":"fresh"},"error":null}
```

- `ok:true` ⇒ `result` object, `error:null`; `ok:false` ⇒ `result:null` and
  `error` shaped like `hf-error/v1`. Mixed responses are refused
  (`rpc/response.malformed.json`).
- Errors carry stable codes; refusal codes (`refusal.*`) are typed and
  never downgraded by clients.

## Local JSONL event protocol: `hf-event/v1` (one event per line)

The daemon appends events to a local JSONL stream for read-only consumers
(the future optional Corral-style adapter boundary, ADR-0003 — dashed and
optional; nothing requires it):

```json
{"schema":"hf-event/v1","event":"state.snapshot","seq":0,"ts":"2026-09-06T00:00:00Z",
 "data":{"repository":"example-org/widgets","epoch":3}}
```

- `event` closed set: `state.snapshot` | `agent.updated` | `plan.updated` |
  `grant.updated` | `journal.appended` | `epoch.rotated` | `schedule.ran`.
- `seq` is a monotonic per-daemon sequence (replay cursor); consumers
  resume from `Last-Seq`, and a stale cursor is answered with a fresh
  snapshot (reconnect semantics are the consumer's concern; the daemon only
  guarantees append-only, seq-ordered, redacted lines).
- `ts` RFC3339 UTC; `data` is an object; every line is self-describing with
  its schema id. Unknown event kinds are refused
  (`event/events.malformed.jsonl`); a non-JSON line fails the stream
  (`event/events.badline.jsonl` refuses at parse).
- Event content is redacted by construction (shared adapter-boundary
  redaction, [spec-cli.md](spec-cli.md)); no credentials ever ride events.

## Read-only independence

`doctor`, `status`, and `plan` never require the daemon to be running
(locked spec). When the daemon is absent, read-only commands operate on
config + direct adapter read-back and report daemon absence as part of the
observation (not as a crash).

## Fixture map

Accept: `request.status.valid.json`, `request.apply.valid.json` (with
idempotency key), `response.ok.valid.json`, `response.error.valid.json`,
`events.valid.jsonl`. Refuse: apply without key, mixed ok/error response,
unknown event kind, non-JSON event line, unknown-version variants of
request/response/event.
