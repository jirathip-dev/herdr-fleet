# canter 1.0 contract artifacts

Refs #3 (Contracts), umbrella #1 (locked spec). This directory turns the
locked 1.0 product decisions into public, reviewable, machine-checked
contract artifacts. It authorizes **no implementation**: commands, the
daemon, adapters, workflows, and migrations are non-goals of #3
([issue body](https://github.com/jirathip-dev/canter/issues/3)).

## Evidence legend

Every document distinguishes **design commitment** (locked by issue #1's
locked-spec/architecture-decision comments; normative for later slices) from
**[awaiting-evidence]** claims (measured compatibility/performance facts that
do not exist yet because no implementation or benchmark run exists). AC10 of
#3 requires this distinction; prose that lacks a marker is a design
commitment.

## Fixture checks

The fixture corpus is machine-checked by a stdlib probe in the repository's
fail-closed scanner style (deterministic exit codes, no network):

```text
python3 scripts/check-contract-fixtures.py      # manifest expectations
python3 scripts/test-check-contract-fixtures.py # tamper discrimination + coherence
```

`check-contract-fixtures.py` asserts every manifest row
([`schemas/fixtures/manifest.jsonl`](../../schemas/fixtures/manifest.jsonl)):
accept fixtures validate, malformed fixtures are refused, unknown-version
fixtures are refused with the version refusal, non-canonical bytes are
refused for canonical families, and known-answer `sha256` digests hold.
`test-check-contract-fixtures.py` mutates committed fixtures in temp copies
to prove each refusal rule bites, and enforces that this table,
`schema-registry.md`, the probe registry, and the manifest name the same 17
families with the same coverage.

Gate wiring: the probe is deliberately **not** referenced from `justfile` or
workflow files in this slice (those paths are owned elsewhere this round;
see the lane fence). Wiring them into `just ci`/CI is a one-line follow-up
for the owning lane once #3 merges.

## Reading order

1. [capability-map.md](capability-map.md) — what 1.0 is, owner by owner
2. [schema-registry.md](schema-registry.md) — every serialized surface at a glance
3. Per-surface specs (config, CLI, plans/grants, workflow, daemon, state,
   capabilities, review evidence)
4. [trust-model.md](trust-model.md) · [risk-model.md](risk-model.md)
5. [corral-archaeology.md](corral-archaeology.md) — public provenance for every
   candidate seam
6. [compatibility.md](compatibility.md) · [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) —
   measured-fact policy and how facts will be produced

Privacy: every committed artifact in this set is synthetic and passes the
public-tree gate (AC8). Do not add real repository names, host paths,
credentials, or downstream policy here.
