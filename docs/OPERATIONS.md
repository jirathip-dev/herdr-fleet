# Operations runbook

Task-ordered, human-oriented guide to operating `herdr-fleet` day to day:
install → configure → observe → plan → daemon/service lifecycle →
grant-gated mutations (dry-run → apply → verify) → cleanup → recovery →
remote transport → upgrade. Every command below was exercised against the
real release binary (`cargo build --release --locked`) in a private,
disposable sandbox with **synthetic fixtures only** — a fake `gh`/`herdr` on
a controlled PATH, a synthetic local git checkout of `example-org/widgets`,
and isolated XDG config/state/runtime dirs. No repository, fleet, host
service manager, or external system was mutated; quoted outputs are trimmed
and host paths are redacted (`.../`), per the repository's public-data rule.

Normative contracts (authoritative; this runbook links, never duplicates):
[contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) (corpus index),
[contracts/spec-cli.md](contracts/spec-cli.md) (envelopes/exit codes),
[contracts/spec-daemon.md](contracts/spec-daemon.md) (RPC),
[contracts/spec-plans.md](contracts/spec-plans.md) (plan/apply/grant/outcome
semantics),
[contracts/spec-lifecycle.md](contracts/spec-lifecycle.md)
(schedules/admission/cleanup/recovery/remote),
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) (archives/upgrade policy).

Exit-code contract (with or without `--json`): 0 ok · 1 operational error ·
2 usage · 3 partial · 4 refusal · 5 config error. In `--json` mode stdout
carries exactly one `hf-output/v1` document; diagnostics go to stderr; JSON
output never prompts.

---

## 1. Install

Prerequisites: Rust 1.97.1 (pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`), `git` on
PATH. `doctor` (section 3) additionally checks `herdr` >= 0.8.2 and
authenticated `gh`; nothing here installs them.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jirathip-dev/herdr-fleet.git
$ cd herdr-fleet
$ cargo build --release --locked
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet --version        # exit 0
herdr-fleet 0.1.0
...
state schema version: 6
migration chain: m0001_initial_state_v1, m0002_workflow_engine_instances_v2, m0003_control_plane_evidence_v3, m0004_schedules_lifecycle_v4, m0005_lane_replacements_v5, m0006_lane_checkpoints_v6
document schema families: hf-config/v1, hf-policy/v1, hf-output/v1, hf-error/v1, ...
```

`--version` reports the schema facts the binary was built against — the
same facts release archives bind to their provenance records
([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)).

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom | Remedy |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo build` fails to fetch | Offline host: pre-fetch with the committed `Cargo.lock` (`cargo fetch --locked`), then `--offline`. |
| `--version` exits != 0 | Wrong toolchain: install the pinned 1.97.1 (see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)) and rebuild `--locked`. |

## 2. Configure

Prerequisites: a target repository identity of the form `owner/name`.

The CLI never writes files: `config init` prints an annotated
`hf-config/v1` template to stdout; you redirect it to the canonical XDG
location yourself.

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet config init > ~/.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml   # exit 0
$ $EDITOR ~/.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml
```

Minimal document (schema + one repository; optional tables only — daemon,
policy, repository, harness, workflow, role):

```toml
schema = "hf-config/v1"

[daemon]
enabled = true

[policy]
overlay = "policy.toml"

[repository.widgets]
origin = "https://github.com/example-org/widgets"
branch = "staging"
enabled = true
```

Validate and inspect:

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet config validate            # exit 0
config valid: .../.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet config validate --json     # exit 0
{"command":"config validate","data":{"config_path":".../.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml",
 "policy_overlay":{"path":".../.config/herdr-fleet/policy.toml","valid":true},
 "valid":true},"exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet config show --json         # exit 0
{"command":"config show","data":{"config_path":".../.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml",
 "daemon_enabled":true,"daemon_socket":null,
 "repositories":[{"branch":"staging","enabled":true,"identity":"example-org/widgets",
 "key":"widgets","origin":"https://github.com/example-org/widgets"}], ...},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom (exit) | Envelope | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Named overlay missing (5) | `policy.not_found` | Create the `[policy] overlay` file you named (it is never implicitly discovered). |
| Unsupported version (5) | `config.invalid`, `refusal: refuse-version` | `schema` must be `hf-config/v1` (and the overlay `hf-policy/v1`); see the template. |
| `--config PATH` unreadable (5) | `config.invalid` | Point `--config` at an existing file or fix permissions. |

## 3. Observe (read-only)

Prerequisites: nothing beyond what you are observing. `doctor` checks git,
`herdr`, and `gh` presence/versions/auth and the config document; it never
installs, starts, or stops anything.

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet doctor --json              # exit 0
{"command":"doctor","data":{"checks":[
 {"detail":"git version 2.52.0","name":"git","status":"ok"},
 {"detail":"herdr 0.8.2 (declared minimum 0.8.2)","name":"herdr","status":"ok"},
 {"detail":"gh 9.9.9; authenticated; scopes: repo, read:org","name":"gh","status":"ok"}],
 "config":{"path":".../.config/herdr-fleet/config.toml","status":"ok"}},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

The Herdr row is a CLI-version gate only. Issue #35 measured that 0.8.2
(protocol 20) and 0.9.0 (protocol 22) clients/servers reject both mixed
pairings with `protocol_mismatch`; see
[compatibility.md](contracts/compatibility.md). During a Herdr update, use
Herdr's own status/handoff workflow and update both endpoints rather than
reading the 0.8.2 doctor floor as mixed-version support. herdr-fleet never
restarts either endpoint.

Declared read capabilities (static; no negotiation, no shell guessing):

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet capabilities --json        # exit 0
{"command":"capabilities","data":{"capability":{
 "actor":"herdr-fleet","axis":"forge",
 "capabilities":["read_refs","read_issues","read_checks"],
 "schema":"hf-capability/v1"}},"exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

`status` observes each enabled configured repository **from inside its
local checkout** (the invoking directory) through local git + authenticated
`gh`, plus a herdr probe. Bounded: at most 4 concurrent observers, 10s per
process; partial failures are explicit, never hidden.

```console
$ cd .../widgets-checkout
$ /path/to/herdr-fleet status --json                      # exit 0
{"command":"status","data":{"expected_repositories":1,"freshness":"fresh",
 "observed_repositories":1,
 "observations":[
  {"completeness":"complete","freshness":"fresh","payload":{
   "compatible":true,"declared_minimum":"0.8.2","present":true,
   "source":"herdr --version","surface":"herdr","version":"0.8.2"},
   "schema":"hf-observation/v1","subject":{"id":"herdr","type":"host"}},
  {"completeness":"complete","freshness":"fresh","observed_at":"<ts>","payload":{
   "git":{"available":true,"branch":"staging","head":"ef1c...b4c8",
    "origin_matches":true,"source":"local git checkout","surface":"git"},
   "github":{"archived":false,"available":true,"default_branch":"staging",
    "identity_matches":true,"remote_identity":"example-org/widgets",
    "source":"gh api repos/owner/name","surface":"github"}},
   "schema":"hf-observation/v1","subject":{"id":"example-org/widgets","type":"repository"}}],
 "timings_ms":{"partial_failures":0,"requests":3,...}},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom (exit) | Envelope/detail | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing prerequisites (3) | checks `status: "missing"`, e.g. `gh not found on PATH — GitHub reads need authenticated gh` | Install/auth the named tool; re-run `doctor`. |
| Config invalid (5) | `config.invalid` | Fix the config per section 2. |
| `github.available:false` (still 0) | `reason: "gh.unavailable"` | Degradation is explicit and reported, not hidden: authenticate `gh` or accept the local-only observation. |
| `git.available:false` (still 0) | `reason: "no_local_checkout"` | Run `status` from the repository's local checkout (or configure the repo you are standing in). |

### 3.1 Monitoring a lane on an unrecognized harness (jcode example)

herdr 0.9.0 recognizes a closed list of agent kinds at spawn ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
"Layer responsibilities"). A harness outside that list — jcode today, a
herdr-fleet first-class adapter (issue #37) but not a herdr agent kind —
runs fine in a pane but never appears as a herdr agent-kind row, so
`herdr agent list` is the wrong surface for its lifecycle; the
agents-sidebar gap is expected, not a defect. Monitor the lane from
herdr-fleet state and the pane rows instead:

1. **State and phase.** The daemon state store is the tracker: the lane's
   plan, route grant, instance, and recorded review evidence live there,
   and every applied step returns a typed `hf-outcome/v1` — `succeeded` |
   `failed` | `refused` | `ambiguous` | `superseded` (section 6;
   [spec-plans.md](contracts/spec-plans.md)). Refusals carry
   `hf-error/v1` codes (`refusal.credentials`, `refusal.grant.expired`,
   ...). The typed exit taxonomy applies to the client surface: 0 ok · 1
   operational · 2 usage · 3 partial · 4 refusal · 5 config error
   ([spec-cli.md](contracts/spec-cli.md)).
2. **Transcript.** The adapter's typed prompt result carries the step's
   transcript (jcode: parsed from the `--json` envelope's `text` field, or
   raw stdout when the output has no envelope shape). Raw prompts and
   transcripts are never persisted (AC8; trust model T5) — the journal
   records the step and its outcome, not the conversation. The live pane
   terminal stays available as the working transcript: `herdr pane read
   <pane>` reads it back at any time (no agent kind required). Herdr 0.9.0
   also returns recent output that is still in the unscrolled viewport; the
   issue #35 live and portable probes pin that behavior.
3. **Semantic lifecycle (adapter-side sideband).** When the pi/jcode
   profile operation runs inside a herdr pane (`HERDR_ENV=1` +
   `HERDR_PANE_ID` in the allowlisted environment), the adapter reports the
   lane through `herdr pane report-agent <pane> --source
   custom:herdr-fleet-pi|custom:herdr-fleet-jcode --agent pi|jcode
   --state ...`: start → `working`; a terminal prompt result → `idle`;
   `refusal.credentials` → `blocked` with the static message `harness
   credentials required`. `pane report-agent` has no `done` input, although
   Herdr may derive `done` for unseen settled agents; consumers accept both
   `idle` and `done`. Releasing the reporting source's authority (`herdr pane
   release-agent`, with the same `--source`/`--agent`) is the lane owner's
   pane-closeout row.

Truthful limits today: the pane rows come from the harness adapter inside
the pane — no herdr-fleet daemon caller drives or consumes them yet in this
bootstrap, and the daemon state store is not wired to them; consuming the
rows in daemon-driven lifecycle reporting is future work on the shipped
issue #8 state. The full row contract is in
[spec-capabilities.md](contracts/spec-capabilities.md).

## 4. Plan (read-only)

Prerequisites: a configured repository (section 2) and either authenticated
`gh` (to derive the acceptance revision from the issue's live text) or an
explicit `--revision <40-hex>`.

`plan` renders a deterministic `hf-plan/v1` — the same inputs always
produce the same canonical bytes and sha256 `digest`, and `state_epoch` is
bound to the state it was computed against. **`plan` never applies
anything.**

Offline (explicit revision):

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet plan example-org/widgets 7 \
    --revision 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 --json   # exit 0
{"command":"plan","data":{
 "digest":"816469e345ff69d255ccb4ed211326f0704dd16c3f2e6eabce2bd87fccd3e87b",
 "issue_source":"argument",
 "plan":{"issue":{"number":7,"revision":"0123...4567"},
  "plan_id":"hf_plan_facc0e46cf38511f","repository":"example-org/widgets",
  "schema":"hf-plan/v1","state_epoch":0,
  "steps":[{"id":"p1","kind":"checkout","params":{"ref":"staging"}},
   {"id":"p2","kind":"worktree_create","params":{"scope":"issues/7"}},
   {"id":"p3","kind":"harness_start","params":null},
   {"id":"p4","kind":"prompt","params":null},
   {"id":"p5","kind":"collect_outcome","params":null},
   {"id":"p6","kind":"review_evidence","params":null},
   {"id":"p7","kind":"merge","params":null},
   {"id":"p8","kind":"cleanup","params":null}],
  "workflow_hash":"a906f1289dee1b1d3f1a5fbe3641c0cfcf166dc645e7a3827d419f010767c01f",
  "workflow_id":"fleet-doctrine-1"}},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Live (revision derived from the issue's redacted acceptance text through
`gh`):

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet plan example-org/widgets 7 --json   # exit 0
{"command":"plan","data":{"digest":"5566...93d",
 "issue_source":"github",
 "plan":{"issue":{"number":7,"revision":"463becfc6674875eee85a7371b3c6037980424ab"}, ...}}
```

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom (exit) | Envelope | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gh` unavailable, no `--revision` (1) | `forge.unavailable` — "pass `--revision <40hex>` to render the plan offline" | Render offline with `--revision` or make `gh` available. |
| Unconfigured repository (2) | stderr: ``plan: no configured repository matches "not-configured"; configure it first (see `herdr-fleet config init`); run `herdr-fleet plan --help``` `` | Add the repository to the config (section 2). |
| Non-numeric issue / malformed `--revision` (2) | usage error on stderr | `<issue>` is a positive integer; `--revision` is exactly 40 hex. |

Determinism check: run the same offline command twice and diff — byte
identical stdout (the digest is over the canonical plan bytes).

## 5. Daemon + service lifecycle

Prerequisites: config with `[daemon] enabled = true` (section 2). The
daemon is a single-writer per-user state server: flock + SQLite state +
audit/event journals + one Unix socket. State location follows XDG
(`.../.local/state/herdr-fleet/...` by default; isolate with
`XDG_STATE_HOME`); the socket defaults to the XDG runtime dir
(`.../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock`) unless `--socket` or `config daemon.socket`
overrides it. A second daemon is refused.

Start (foreground — run it in a terminal or under a service unit, section
5.1):

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon run
# daemon.log: {"event":"daemon.start",...} {"event":"daemon.ready",
#  "message":"state open; reconciled 0 interrupted claim(s); serving .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock",...}
```

Probe from another terminal:

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon status --json       # exit 0 (live)
{"command":"daemon status","data":{"daemon":{"pid":<pid>,
 "started_at":"<ts>","version":"0.1.0"},
 "freshness":"fresh","state":{"active_grants":0,"epoch":1,"event_seq":0,
 "journal_seq":0,"pending_claims":0,"poisoned":false,"schema_version":6}},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Stop the daemon with Ctrl-C / SIGTERM in the daemon terminal. The binary
installs no signal handler, so the socket file is **not** unlinked on exit:
immediately after a stop — or a crash — `daemon status` reports the stale
socket:

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon status --json   # after stop/crash: exit 1
{"command":"daemon status","error":{"code":"daemon.stale","details":null,
 "message":"a stale daemon socket exists at .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock; a fresh `daemon run` reclaims it","retryable":true},
 "exit_code":1,"kind":"error","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Remedy: start a fresh `daemon run` — it reclaims the stale socket,
reopens/migrates the state, and reconciles interrupted claims on start;
verify with `daemon status --json` again (exit 0). Full recovery flow:
section 8.

The `daemon.absent` envelope below appears only when the runtime directory
never served a daemon (fresh boot or a fresh XDG runtime dir) or after the
stale socket has been reclaimed/removed:

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon status --json       # exit 1
{"command":"daemon status","error":{"code":"daemon.absent","details":null,
 "message":"no daemon is running on .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock; read-only commands (doctor/status/plan) stay available without it","retryable":false},
 "exit_code":1,"kind":"error","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Read-only commands stay available without the daemon.

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom (exit) | Detail | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Second daemon refused (1) | stderr: `another daemon is already running: another daemon holds the lock (pid <pid> ...)` | One daemon per user by design; probe with `daemon status`, do not stack daemons. |
| No daemon (1) | `daemon.absent` | Start `daemon run` (or the service unit). |
| Stale socket (1, retryable) | `daemon.stale` — "a stale daemon socket exists ...; a fresh `daemon run` reclaims it" | Start a fresh `daemon run`; it reclaims the socket (section 8). |
| Wrong socket probed | `daemon.absent` naming a path you did not serve | Match `--socket` (or config `daemon.socket`) between `run` and `status`, or use the default path on both. |

### 5.1 Service units (plans only — never activated by the CLI)

`service doctor` checks the daemon environment read-only; the `*-plan`
commands render the first-party per-user launchd/systemd unit text and the
exact host steps. **They never install, start, stop, or query the host
service manager** — a human executes the rendered steps on the target host.

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet service doctor --json      # exit 0
{"command":"service doctor","data":{"checks":[
 {"detail":"systemd","name":"platform","status":"ok"},
 {"detail":"daemon.enabled=true","name":"config","status":"found"},
 {"detail":"daemon not running","name":"socket","status":"absent"},
 {"detail":".../.config/systemd/user/herdr-fleet.service","name":"service-unit","status":"absent"}],
 "summary":{"daemon":"absent","platform":"systemd","unit":"absent"}},
 "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet service install-plan --json   # exit 0
{"command":"service install-plan","data":{"platform":"systemd",
 "steps":[
  "write the rendered unit to .../.config/systemd/user/herdr-fleet.service (content printed by the install command)",
  "run: systemctl --user daemon-reload",
  "run: systemctl --user enable --now herdr-fleet.service",
  "verify: systemctl --user --no-pager status herdr-fleet.service"],
 "target":".../.config/systemd/user/herdr-fleet.service",
 "unit":"# herdr-fleet per-user daemon unit (issue #5; rendered, not activated)
[Unit]
Description=herdr-fleet state daemon (single writer per user)
...
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=<herdr-fleet-binary> daemon run --socket .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
NoNewPrivileges=true
...
"}, "exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

`service status-plan` renders the verification steps and `service
uninstall-plan` the removal steps for the same unit; both exit 0 and both
contain the unit text for inspection.

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom (exit) | Detail | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service doctor` rows not ok | e.g. `daemon.enabled=false` in config, socket absent | Enable the daemon in config / start the daemon first; re-run `service doctor`. |
| Wrong platform unit | `platform` row says `launchd`/`systemd` | The renderer targets the host it runs on; run `*-plan` on the target host (macOS → launchd, Linux → systemd). |

## 6. Grant-gated mutations (daemon `apply` — RPC only)

Boundary: the CLI surface is read-only. There is **no** CLI subcommand that
mutates; the only mutation path is the daemon `apply` RPC over the local
socket (issue #8 semantics, [spec-plans.md](contracts/spec-plans.md),
[spec-daemon.md](contracts/spec-daemon.md)). The material below is the operator
workflow in terms of the documented contract and is **synthetic guidance**:
this repository never mutates real repositories, fleets, or external state,
and its tests use disposable local repositories and fakes only.

Workflow: **render → grant → apply one step at a time → verify**, always
with a fresh interactive TTY for production-branch effects.

1. **Dry-run (render + validate).** Render the plan (section 4), keep the
   envelope: `plan_id`, `digest`, `state_epoch`, and the exact step ids are
   what grants and applies bind to. A plan's digest is over its canonical
   bytes; any tamper changes the digest and apply refuses it
   (`refusal.plan.identity`).
2. **Grant.** A route grant (`hf-grant/v1`) is the only authorization to
   start durable work. It binds repository, plan digest, capabilities,
   role/policy hashes, `state_epoch`, expiry, and instance. Grants are
   issued/consumed by the daemon, expire, and die with their epoch —
   request one from the daemon (`grants.list` shows live grants;
   `grants.revoke` cancels one).
3. **Apply.** `apply` executes **one plan step per request** and requires
   `params.idempotency_key` (`ik_` + 8-64 `[a-z0-9-]`). The daemon
   recomputes the digest before anything is journaled, then revalidates
   under the state lock: live epoch vs plan/grant/instance, grant status
   and expiry (expired → `refusal.grant.expired`), the observed issue
   revision vs the grant binding, workflow/policy hashes, and the step's
   required capability. The intent is journaled (`mutate.*`) before the
   effect; the effect runs outside the lock through allowlisted
   subprocesses; the response is a typed `hf-outcome/v1`.
4. **Verify.** Read the exact result back: the recorded outcome for a
   consumed idempotency key is returned instead of re-dispatching
   (exactly-once read-back; at-most-once dispatch). Replaying a request id
   + key returns the recorded response. Kind-specific verification gates
   run before sensitive steps: an integration merge requires current
   review evidence bound to head/base/workflow/policy (moved bindings →
   `refusal.evidence.stale`); issue closure requires the instance to sit at
   `post_merge_verify` with passing evidence; production-branch effects
   require a fresh interactive TTY-confirmed digest; real-external target
   scopes require the recorded first-write approval.

Outcome statuses: `succeeded` | `failed` | `refused` | `ambiguous` |
`superseded`. `failed`/`refused` outcomes carry an `hf-error/v1`-shaped
error. `ambiguous` (timeout, process death, post-effect record failure)
**always requires external reconciliation before a new key**.

Failure → remedy:

| Symptom | Detail | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apply refused | `refusal.plan.identity` | The carried plan bytes were tampered; re-render and re-grant. |
| Apply refused | `refusal.grant.expired` / epoch mismatch | Re-issue a grant against the live epoch; material edits or restore rotated the epoch and invalidated prior grants. |
| Merge refused | `refusal.evidence.stale` | Re-review at the moved head; evidence must bind the current head/base/workflow/policy. |
| Outcome `ambiguous` | interrupted/restored work | External reconciliation required before a new idempotency key — never blindly retry. |
| Mutation request rejected | missing/`ik_`-malformed idempotency key | Every mutating apply requires a well-formed `params.idempotency_key`. |

## 7. Cleanup and archives

- **Worktree cleanup / salvage** (issue #9): the daemon's cleanup path
  archives rather than destroys — cleanup keeps its salvage audit pair
  (`mutate.cleanup` before, `salvage.cleanup` after) with byte-verified
  manifests. Operator-facing semantics, retention, and audit deletion:
  [spec-lifecycle.md](contracts/spec-lifecycle.md) sections 5 and 7.
- **Backups**: `backup.create` snapshots state through the daemon;
  retention-bounded pruning keeps the backup set bounded. Restore is an
  epoch event: `restore.begin` creates a new state epoch, marks interrupted
  work `ambiguous`, invalidates prior grants/digests, and only then do new
  grants issue — see [spec-plans.md](contracts/spec-plans.md) (epoch restore) and
  [spec-lifecycle.md](contracts/spec-lifecycle.md).
- **Release archives** (issue #10) are a separate, human-gated surface:
  deterministic platform archives with checksums + offline SBOM +
  provenance are built by `scripts/build-archive.py` per
  [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md); release execution is human-only.

## 8. Recovery after crash / cold boot

The daemon is designed to be restarted freely; state is SQLite + journals,
and the socket is reclaimable.

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon status --json   # after a crash/kill: exit 1
{"command":"daemon status","error":{"code":"daemon.stale",...,
 "message":"a stale daemon socket exists at .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock; a fresh `daemon run` reclaims it",...},
 "exit_code":1,"kind":"error","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

Remedy — start a fresh daemon; it reclaims the stale socket, opens/migrates
the state, and reconciles interrupted claims:

```console
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon run     # foreground; on ready, daemon.log shows
#  "state open; reconciled 0 interrupted claim(s); serving .../herdr-fleet/daemon.sock"
$ ./target/release/herdr-fleet daemon status --json    # exit 0 — live again
{"command":"daemon status","data":{"daemon":{"pid":<pid>,...},
 "state":{"active_grants":0,"epoch":1,...}},"exit_code":0,"kind":"ok","schema":"hf-output/v1"}
```

- **Cold boot**: the daemon runs the same recovery plus one fresh
  evaluation per due schedule before the socket serves; recovery never
  depends on herdr/git/gh being present (spec-lifecycle.md section 3).
- **Journal inspection**: `journal.tail` reads the audit/event streams;
  interrupted claims are reconciled at startup (the journal is the
  authority for what was journaled before an effect).
- **Restore after corruption/restore events**: epoch rotates (section 7);
  interrupted work becomes `ambiguous` and needs external reconciliation.
- Read-only commands never need the daemon — observing and planning stay
  available while the daemon is down.

### 8.1 Integration branch deleted (staging)

`staging` is the permanent integration branch and the HEAD of every
promotion PR (`staging` → `main`; see [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md),
"Promotion (staging → main)"). If the repository's automatic head-branch
deletion setting (`delete_branch_on_merge`, "automatically delete head
branches") is enabled, merging a promotion PR deletes `staging` itself —
this happened after promotion PR #28 and blocked all later merges until a
maintainer recreated the branch by hand. The CI `policy` job fails every
run while `staging` is missing ("Integration branch exists (staging
guard)" step); restore the branch before merging anything else:

1. Confirm the branch is missing — empty output means gone:

   ```console
   $ git ls-remote origin refs/heads/staging
   ```

2. Find the last known head SHA of `staging`. Candidates, in order:

   - the deleted promotion PR's head SHA — GitHub keeps it after deletion
     (`gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid`),
   - a local remote-tracking ref fetched before the deletion
     (`git rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/staging`), or
   - the promotion squash-merge commit on `main` (it was created from
     `staging`'s head).

3. Restore the branch from that SHA:

   ```console
   $ git push origin <last-known-sha>:refs/heads/staging
   ```

   If the ruleset rejects the direct push to the long-lived branch, create
   the ref through the GitHub refs API instead (run inside a checkout of
   this repository so `gh` fills in `{owner}/{repo}`):

   ```console
   $ gh api --method POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs \
     -f ref=refs/heads/staging -f sha=<last-known-sha>
   ```

4. Verify the restore, then re-check the setting:

   ```console
   $ git ls-remote origin refs/heads/staging    # must print the restored SHA
   ```

   Confirm the repository's automatic head-branch deletion
   (`delete_branch_on_merge`) is **off** — a promotion PR whose head is
   `staging` must never auto-delete it again. Restoring the ref directly
   is the recovery action; it is not a PR and does not change promotion
   policy.

## 9. Remote transport boundary

The system-SSH remote transport is a **verified contract**, not a live
background feature of the CLI: the surface an operator reaches is local
(git/gh/herdr on the invoking host; the daemon on the per-user socket).
Remote semantics — what may cross an SSH boundary, and the verified
transport contract — are specified in
[spec-lifecycle.md](contracts/spec-lifecycle.md) section 6. Nothing in this
repository connects outward from CI or lanes, and no harness session runs
from public CI or fork PRs.

## 10. Upgrade

1. Pull the new release, rebuild pinned: `cargo build --release --locked`.
2. Check the schema facts: `herdr-fleet --version` (migration chain must
   include the new `mNNNN_*` entry).
3. Stop the daemon/service (Ctrl-C, or the service steps from section
   5.1), start the new binary — the daemon opens/migrates SQLite state on
   start (`daemon.ready` in `daemon.log`), then verify with
   `daemon status --json` (state row shows `schema_version`).
4. Re-issue grants after any restore/epoch rotation (section 7); schedules
   survive restarts by design and stay paused until explicitly resumed.
5. Release/version policy, archive verification, and rollback notes:
   [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
